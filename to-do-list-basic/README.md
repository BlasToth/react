# New things for me:

## Getting Started with Create React App

- create-react-app . ( in a folder that does not contain any spaces in its name )
( "."  --> use the current folder )

- In the project directory, you can run: 
## `npm start`

- It is not allowed to put 2 JSX elements next to each other inside of a return() ( return can only return one thing )
HACK: wrap everything inside of an empty element: <> </>

- STATE: { useState } hook
 useState() returns an array, so we can destructure it.

- { JS code } - Js code can be written into curly braces
